Sentiment Analysis refers to the use of Natural Language Processing to determine the attitude, opinions and emotions of a speaker, writer, or other subject within an online mention.

The intent is to create a Sentiment Analysis of a tweet or a set of tweets, using Naive-Bayes Classification.
The tweets will be collected and stored in a .csv file; it will be the program's training and test data.The only planned interaction is the copying of the tweet itself: no other data will be collected or any other interaction performed.
The tweets will be displayed off-Twitter when testing the algorithm, to ensure its accuracy. Once completed, a particular tweet or set of tweets chosen to be analysed will also be displayed in the program itself.
