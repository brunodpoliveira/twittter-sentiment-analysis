# How to contribute

Modeled after OpenGovernment contributing guidelines https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find me in LinkedIn ([#LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-daniel-pinheiro-de-oliveira-b4024859/)).

All of this project consists of Python code.

## Submitting changes
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://https://github.com/brunodpoliveira/twittter-sentiment-analysis/pulls/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (below)

Always write a clear log message for your commits.

## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it.

  * All data must be stored in the data/ folder
  * File, variable and class names are written in lowercase, separated by an underline (word_bag, not wordbag or WordBag)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * Tasks inside code are separated by # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
  
Thanks,
Bruno Daniel
